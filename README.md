###Overview
A simplistic site to visually display the booking data for my family's holiday letting company. The data is pulled in from an excel CSV file, converted into JSON and then rendered in a variety of formats on the page.

###Approach/How it works

When the user arrives at the site they are met with sleek loading animations as the graphs render on the page. All the data is automatically inherited, and extra information is available to the user when interacting with the graphs by hovering etc.

###The Build

* HTML5
* Node.js
* Express
* CSS3 animations
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* JSON (Converted from CSV file)
* Chart.js
* Gulp

### Problems & Challenges 

Chart.js! Working on a project with no external database.

### MVP 2
* Use Gulp to automatically update the JSON file when a change is made to the live CSV spreadsheet. 
* Make the graphs objects draggable, to enable easier comparison.
* Click events on graphs to alter the dataset.
